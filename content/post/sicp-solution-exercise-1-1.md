## Exercise 1.1

> Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result printed by the interpreter in response to each expression? Assume that the sequence is to be evaluated in the order in which it is presented.

## Solution

The result of the evaluation is after the `>` bellow:

```scheme
10
> 10

(+ 5 3 4)
> 12

(- 9 1)
> 8

(/ 6 2)
> 3

(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))
> 6

(define a 3)
>

(define b (+ a 1))
>

(+ a b (* a b))
> 19

(= a b)
> #f

(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
    b
    a)
> 4

(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))
> 16

(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
> 6

(* (cond ((> a b) a)
         ((< a b) b)
         (else -1))
   (+ a 1))
> 16
```
